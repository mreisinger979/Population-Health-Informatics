#Public Health Disease Surveillance Architecture Development Projec

## Overview

This is a step by step process into creating a Disease Surveillance Architecture using a virtual machine environment.

## Step One: Configuring the Virtual Machine

I first created 4 virtual machines using an ubuntu docker template. These machines were to represent 4 hospitals located in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Each machine was configured using specific guidelines.

## Step Two: Installation, Configuration, and Security of OpenEMR

An electronic health record (EHR) was then installed and configured in each virtual machine

## Step Three: Generation of Synthea Patient and Syndromic Surveillance Data for Hospital EHRs to Simulate Disease Outbreak

Synthetic patient and syndromic surveillance data was generated for each hospital EHR

## Step Four: Installation and Configuration of Hapi-FHIR Server

A Hapi-FHIR server was installed and configured into a 5th virtual machine that contains a Health Information Exchange (HIE)

## Step Five: Interoperability - FHIR Data Exchange with Hapi-FHIR

Demonstrated the role of Hapi-FHIR in exchanging HL7 FHIR messages from EHRs
